# On Route App

A navigation and mapping tool for everyone, right in the browser.

No API keys, no registration, no app stores and no invasions of privacy. Just open the app and get where you are going.

Built with the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) ecosystem. Special thanks to [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) for tile hosting.

## Features

- Detailed, free global map — no install, no account
- Globe view on first load
- GPS locate with compass heading
- Record GPS tracks and export as GPX
- Offline capable (cached tiles and data)
- Multilingual (auto-detects browser language)
- Shareable map links
- Map view persisted between sessions
- Light and dark mode
- Works on any device

## Planned Changes

- Worldwide language support
- Search ([Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) integration)
- Better handling of denied location permissions
- Improved offline capabilities
- Dark map style

## Drawbacks and Limitations

- Location permissions are required for GPS/Compass features. Some users have a deny-all approach to browser permissions and changing them varies between browsers and devices.
- The app does not work in the background or when the device is locked — a common limitation of web apps.
- Depending on a single tile provider ([OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/)) creates a single point of failure. Self-hosting is an option worth pursuing.
- The app requires an initial connection to load assets and map tiles, even though it works offline thereafter.
